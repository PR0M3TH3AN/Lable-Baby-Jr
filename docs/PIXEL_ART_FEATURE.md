# Pixel Art — editable pixel layers & raster export

## Goals

Make Artstr a genuine, Nostr-native **pixel-art editor**. The user paints
on a hard-edged pixel grid; the editable grid lives in the project JSON
as compact palette-indexed data; PNG (and later GIF) are produced as
**exports**, never as the source of truth.

### The core realisation

Pixel art fits Artstr's JSON/Nostr model *better* than ordinary raster
editing does. A 64×64 sprite is a tiny indexed grid — compact, portable,
forkable, replaceable as a `kind:30078` event. The rule:

> Never store pixel art as a PNG while editing. Store it as an editable
> palette-indexed grid in the Artstr JSON; rasterise to PNG/GIF on export.

### Two faces — the disc-design / slide pattern, generalised

Pixel art has the same dual nature as a disc design or a slide — a
standalone publishable thing *and* an embeddable component — but
generalised: because it is a **layer type**, its host is not one specific
template, it is *any design*.

| Standalone design | Embeds into | As a… |
|---|---|---|
| Disc design | a disc-label sheet | disc **slot** |
| Slide | a slide deck | **card** |
| **Pixel art** | **any design** | **layer** |

- **Standalone** — a `kind:30078` event, `casewrap-pixelart`, a "Pixel
  Art" layout on the **Designer tab** beside Custom Art / Slide / Disc
  Design. Forkable, editable-in-place, `naddr`-shareable, encryptable.
- **Embedded** — a `pixelart` layer inside *any* design (cover, custom
  art, slide, deck card, stack card). The pixel data embeds **inline** in
  the host's event — the host stays self-contained, exactly like an
  embedded slide or a disc-in-slot.

### Product goals

1. A **`pixelart` layer type** — a palette-indexed pixel grid, usable in
   any design, rendered crisp (nearest-neighbour) at any scale.
2. A **Pixel Editor** — its own canvas-area view with a contextual pixel
   tool set: paint, fill, pick, palette, grid, zoom.
3. A standalone **Pixel Art** Designer-tab layout, publishing as
   `casewrap-pixelart`; importable into any design as a layer.
4. **PNG export** at 1× / 2× / 4× / 8×, transparency preserved.
5. (Later) **animation frames** and **GIF / sprite-sheet** export.

### Non-goals (v1 = Phase A)

- **GIF / animation in v1** — frames are designed into the data model
  from day one, but the timeline UI and the (vendored) GIF encoder are
  Phase C.
- **Whole-design → PNG export.** Rasterising an arbitrary layered Artstr
  artboard is a separate, harder problem (the DOM-to-raster question).
  This spec only rasterises *pixel content*. General design→PNG is out of
  scope here.
- **Image import / quantization, selection/move, dither, onion skin,
  symmetry, tile mode** — Phase C/D.
- **Embedding binary images** — pixel data is always the indexed grid,
  never an embedded PNG blob.
- **External media offload** (Blossom) — inline only for v1; a manifest
  escape hatch is sketched for later.

### Decisions (proposed — confirm before building)

1. **Layer-type-first.** The `pixelart` *layer* is the core. The
   standalone "Pixel Art" mode is a thin wrapper — a project that is one
   pixel grid.
2. **The Pixel Editor is its own canvas-area view** (`#pixelEditorView`),
   not a toolbar tool — joining `#discDesignerView` and `#deckSorterView`.
   The left tool palette is reused as a *contextual* host showing pixel
   tools while it's active.
3. **Frames from day one** — `pixelArt.frames[]` always exists; a v1
   static sprite is simply a one-frame stack with no timeline UI.
4. **Indexed palette + RLE**, never raw RGBA. Raster is export-only.
5. Additive schema — a `pixelart` layer type and a `pixelArt` payload
   object. No `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump.
6. **Publishing is gated on a measured event-size budget** (derived from
   the relays' NIP-11 limits), not on grid dimensions alone — see
   **Size limits**.

## Implementation status

All four phases shipped.

- **Phase A1 — embedded pixel layer: shipped.** The `pixelart` layer
  type + `pixelArt` data model (palette + RLE frames),
  `renderPixelGridToCanvas` and crisp rendering across the editor /
  preview-DOM renderers / export canvas. A `#pixelEditorView` with
  pencil / eraser / fill / eyedropper, a palette panel (pick / add),
  grid toggle, mirror X/Y, zoom, and per-stroke in-editor undo.
  Reachable via the **▦** tool-palette button and an "Edit pixels"
  button / double-click on a selected pixel layer.
- **Phase A2 — standalone Pixel Art design: shipped.**
  `templateMode: 'pixelart'` — a "Pixel Art" layout on the Designer
  tab where the editor view is the whole canvas area, bound to
  `state.pixelArt`. Save / load / publish / fork as
  `casewrap-pixelart`; shows in the community feed under the new
  `pixel-art` category.
- **Phase B — raster export + editor extras: shipped.** Crisp PNG
  export at 1× / 2× / 4× / 8× / 16× / 32× with transparency and
  optional grid lines, sprite-sheet PNG (Grid or Row layout) for
  multi-frame designs, line / rectangle / ellipse tools with a Fill
  toggle, flip H/V + rotate 90° CW/CCW, grid resize (4–128 per side
  with top-left anchor and transparent fill), and a Browse-community
  / Import-from-file pipeline that drops a published or local
  pixel-art design into the current design as a new layer.
- **Phase C — animation: shipped.** Multi-frame `frames[]` data model
  with a vertical timeline strip (add / duplicate / delete /
  drag-reorder / click-to-select frames; arrow keys cycle), playback
  with FPS (1–60) and Loop controls (Space to toggle, clicking the
  canvas stops), Aseprite-style red-prev / blue-next onion-skin
  toggle, sprite-sheet PNG export, and an inline GIF89a encoder for
  animated GIF export — palette-indexed, no vendored dependency.
  Multi-frame previews animate everywhere they're rendered (publish
  modal, community browser, feed cards, profile pages).
- **Phase D — conversion: shipped.** "From image / GIF…" button in
  the pixel editor toolbar: pick any image file → live side-by-side
  preview as you tune W / H / Colors / fit mode (Cover / Fit /
  Stretch) → median-cut palette quantization → area-averaged
  downscale → applies into the editor as a drop-in replacement
  (one undo restores the prior state).
- **Phase D2 — animation import: shipped.** An **inline GIF89a
  decoder** — the mirror of the encoder, no vendored dependency —
  turns an animated GIF into one editor frame per GIF frame. A
  browser `<img>` only ever exposes frame 0 to canvas, so decoding
  is the only way to get at the rest. It handles LZW, interlacing,
  local colour tables, transparency, and all three disposal methods
  (frames composite over their predecessor, so partial
  "changed-rectangle" frames render correctly).
  - **One shared palette** across every frame, quantized from all
    frames together — per-frame palettes made an animation shimmer
    and burned through the 256-entry cap.
  - **Playback FPS from the source**, taken as the median frame delay
    (robust against the long pause frame animations often end on);
    per-frame `durationMs` is preserved in the payload.
  - **Frames** control evenly samples a long animation down, and the
    decoder bounds both frame count and working resolution so a big
    GIF can't exhaust memory — whatever it drops is reported, never
    silent.
  - A GIF already at grid size with a limited palette imports
    **pixel-exact**: the downscaler switches to nearest-neighbour at
    1:1 or integer ratios, and the quantizer keeps the source's exact
    colours when there are fewer than requested.
- **Undo / redo integration.** The pixel editor's local undo /
  redo is driven by the top-level Undo / Redo buttons while the
  editor is open, and falls back to the global design history
  when the editor is closed. Snapshots capture all frames plus
  the current-frame index, so an undo across a flip / rotate /
  resize restores everything coherently. Standalone-mode edits
  push debounced entries to the global stack too.

Not built (deferred to the backlog): WebP / APNG / animated-WebP
export, Blossom offload + external manifest form for very large art,
and animated pixel layers that drive Stack actions on click.

## Why this fits the repo

### What's reused

- **The layer system** — a `pixelart` layer moves / resizes / rotates /
  z-orders / locks / clips / sets opacity like any other layer; it shows
  in the Layers panel; it rides in every payload and preview.
- **The "separate canvas-area view" pattern** — `#previewShell` already
  swaps between `#sheetWrap`, `#discDesignerView`, and `#deckSorterView`.
  `#pixelEditorView` is one more.
- **The edit round-trip** — entering the pixel editor for an embedded
  layer and writing back on exit is the deck's "edit a slide → Back to
  deck" pattern (`persistEditingDeckSlide` / `editingIndex`).
- **The Designer-tab layout system** — a `pixelart` `templateMode` slots
  into `applyLayout`, `WORKFLOW_ORDER`, `updateBodyClasses`,
  `normalizeTemplateMode`, `MODE_LABELS`, exactly as `slide` did.
- **Undo/redo** — the 50-deep snapshot history already covers `state`;
  a pixel layer's data is in `state`, so a paint stroke is an ordinary
  history entry.
- **Publish / fork / feed / encryption** — a pixel-art design is a normal
  `kind:30078` design; the private-publishing envelope wraps it free.
- **Import-as-component** — pulling a published `casewrap-pixelart` in as
  a layer mirrors the disc-design → disc-slot import flow.

### Genuinely new work

1. The **`pixelart` layer type** + the indexed-grid + RLE data model.
2. A shared **`renderPixelGridToCanvas()`** — the app's first real
   raster/`<canvas>` layer (everything is DOM/SVG today).
3. The **Pixel Editor view** + the contextual pixel tool set + palette.
4. A **PNG export pipeline** — `<canvas>.toBlob()`; the app has no direct
   canvas raster export today (JPEG goes via PDF→PDF.js).
5. (Later) the **frame timeline** and a **vendored GIF encoder**.

### Current-state facts the plan is built on

- Layer types today: `image`, `text`, `color`, `shape`, `qr`; layers
  render as absolutely-positioned DOM nodes from inch coordinates.
- The canvas region swaps views by mode (`#sheetWrap` /
  `#discDesignerView` / `#deckSorterView`); the tool palette is already
  rendered contextually (only ▶ Present shows in the deck sorter).
- `casewrap-*` typed `kind:30078` events; `/share/<naddr>`; the community
  feed; categories include `slide`, `slide-deck`.
- "Export JPEG" round-trips through PDF + PDF.js — there is **no** direct
  `canvas.toBlob()` raster path yet.

## Data model

### The `pixelart` layer

```js
{
  id: 'l_x1',
  type: 'pixelart',
  name: 'Pixel sprite',
  // standard layer box — inches, on the host canvas:
  x, y, w, h, rotate, opacity, z, visible, locked, clip,
  pixelArt: {
    width: 64, height: 64,            // grid size, in cells
    palette: [                        // up to 256 entries, #rrggbbaa
      '#00000000',                    // index 0 — transparent by convention
      '#1a1a2eff',
      '#e94560ff'
    ],
    frames: [
      { id: 'f1', name: 'Frame 1', durationMs: 120, pixels: <RLE> }
    ],
    loop: true, fps: 8                // animation playback (Phase C)
  }
}
```

- **`frames` always exists.** A v1 static sprite has exactly one frame
  and no timeline UI — but the format never needs migrating when
  animation lands.
- **`pixels` is run-length-encoded**, row-major: an array of
  `[paletteIndex, runLength]` pairs.

  ```js
  pixels: [ [0,128], [1,24], [2,8], [1,24] ]
  // 128 transparent, 24 colour-1, 8 colour-2, 24 colour-1
  ```

  RLE suits pixel art's long flat runs and stays human-portable JSON, but
  is *worse* than raw for noisy art — so each frame stores **whichever is
  smaller**: `pixels` (RLE `[[index,count],…]`) **or** `pixelsB64`
  (base64 of a raw `Uint8Array` of indices, ~1.34 B/cell). Exactly one is
  present per frame. This bounds the worst case — see **Size limits**.
- **Palette** holds `#rrggbbaa` strings (alpha lets index 0 be fully
  transparent); capped at 256 so an index is one byte.
- The layer **box defaults to the grid's aspect ratio**, and its W/H
  aspect-lock (already a layer feature) defaults *on* — pixels stay
  square; the host never stretches them.

### Standalone Pixel Art design (`templateMode: 'pixelart'`)

```js
{
  version: SCHEMA_VERSION,
  templateMode: 'pixelart',
  templateType: 'pixelart',
  meta: { … },                        // title / category / language
  pixelArt: { width, height, palette, frames, loop, fps }
}
```

The standalone project *is* one pixel grid — `pixelArt` sits at the top
level (mirroring how a slide carries `slide`, a disc design carries
`discDesign`). **Importing** it into another design lifts that `pixelArt`
into a fresh `pixelart` layer; **publishing** a layer standalone does the
reverse. After import the two are independent (a fork).

### Nostr

- Tag `casewrap-pixelart`; `d`-tag `pixelart:<title|id>` (random when
  published privately, per `PRIVATE_PUBLISHING_FEATURE.md`).
- New `pixel-art` category (joining `slide`, `slide-deck`).
- Forkable, editable-in-place (NIP-33), `naddr`-shareable, encryptable.

## Size limits & the event budget

A pixel layer must never *silently* break publishing. Relays cap event
size individually (commonly 64 KB; some 128 / 256 KB), and an oversized
event is **rejected by some relays and accepted by others** — so the
design seems to publish but is unreliable. The budget covers the **whole
signed event**: every other layer, `meta`, tags, and ~270 B of
id / pubkey / sig.

### Why the indexed grid is small

Coordinates are **never stored** — cells are row-major, so position is
free. Hex is stored **once** in `palette`; each cell is just a small
index. RLE then collapses flat runs. A filled 64×64 sprite stored naively
as `[x, y, hex]` triples is **~90 KB**; the same sprite as an indexed RLE
grid is **~1–5 KB** — a 20–90× difference. Dropping coordinates and
de-duplicating the hex is the whole efficiency win.

### Rough sizes — encoded pixel data, one frame

RLE size is content-dependent (great for flat art, worse than raw for
noise); the encoder picks the smaller of RLE / base64, bounding the worst
case at ~1.34 B/cell.

| Grid | Cells | Typical (RLE) | Worst case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16×16 | 256 | ~0.2 KB | ~0.35 KB |
| 32×32 | 1,024 | ~0.5–1.5 KB | ~1.4 KB |
| 64×64 | 4,096 | ~1–5 KB | ~5.5 KB |
| 128×128 | 16,384 | ~3–20 KB | ~22 KB |
| 256×256 | 65,536 | ~10–60 KB | ~88 KB |

Palette is minor (~12 B per colour). **Animation multiplies by frame
count** — that is where the budget is actually spent.

### The limits

- **Dimensions** — 256×256 hard max; 128×128 recommended ceiling; **32×32
  default** for a new grid. Palette ≤ 256 entries (1-byte indices).
- **Event byte gate — the real guard** (dimensions alone can't predict
  size). Before publishing, the app measures the would-be event size
  against a budget:
  - The budget is the **minimum `limitation.max_event_size`** advertised
    via NIP-11 across the user's relay set, falling back to **64 KB** when
    unknown.
  - **Soft warning at ~50%** of budget — suggests a smaller grid, fewer
    colours, or fewer frames.
  - **Hard block at ~90%** — publishing is refused with a clear message,
    instead of letting the event be silently dropped.
  - So a clean 256×256 publishes fine; a pathologically noisy one is
    caught before it half-publishes.
- **Live readout** — the Pixel Editor always shows current data size
  against the budget (e.g. *"Sprite data: 6.2 KB / 48 KB"*).
- **Oversized animations** route to the external-`manifest` / Blossom
  escape hatch (Phase C); inline storage covers everything that fits.

In short: single static sprites up to ~128×128 are always safe inline;
256×256 works unless the art is pathological; multi-frame animation is
the real pressure point and gets the offload path.

## Rendering

One shared helper, used by the editor, every preview renderer, the feed
cards, and export:

```
renderPixelGridToCanvas(pixelArt, frameIndex = 0) -> HTMLCanvasElement
```

- Decodes the frame's RLE into the `palette`, draws each cell as a 1×1
  fill onto an offscreen `<canvas>` sized exactly `width × height`.
- A `pixelart` layer renders as that `<canvas>` placed in the layer's
  div, `width:100%; height:100%; image-rendering: pixelated` — the CSS
  equivalent of `imageSmoothingEnabled = false`, so any up-scaling stays
  crisp.
- The decoded canvas is **memoised** keyed by the frame's pixel data, so
  the per-render layer rebuild stays cheap.
- `renderCustomArtPreviewDOM` (feed cards / publish preview) uses the
  same helper — pixel layers preview correctly everywhere.

---

## The Pixel Editor

`#pixelEditorView` — a new canvas-area view, shown when:

- a standalone Pixel Art design is open, **or**
- the user picks **"Edit pixels"** on a selected `pixelart` layer (or
  double-clicks it) inside any other design.

It contains a zoomed, paintable pixel-grid `<canvas>` with its own
zoom/pan, a **palette panel**, and the **contextual tool palette** (the
left palette slot, populated with pixel tools instead of the vector
tools — exactly as the deck sorter shows only ▶ Present).

**Entering / leaving** follows the deck round-trip: for an embedded
layer, "Edit pixels" enters; **"Done"** writes the grid back to the layer
and returns to the host artboard. For a standalone design the editor
*is* the project.

### v1 tools (Phase A core)

```
Pencil      paint cells with the current palette index
Eraser      paint index 0 (transparent)
Fill        flood-fill contiguous same-index region
Eyedropper  set current index from a cell
```

Plus: a **palette panel** (swatches; add / edit / remove a colour; pick
the current colour), a **grid overlay** toggle, **mirror X / Y** drawing,
and the editor's own **zoom** (fit / 1× / + / −). Drawing supports
click-and-drag; a whole drag-stroke is **one** undo entry (history is
pushed at stroke start, not per cell).

### Phase B tools

`Line`, `Rectangle`, `Ellipse`; whole-grid `Flip H / V` and `Rotate 90°`;
**resize the grid** (change `width`/`height`, anchored).

### Phase C / D tools

Selection + move; dither brush; onion-skin (needs frames); symmetry; tile
preview; image-import → pixelate/quantize.

---

## Raster export

PNG first — a clean, self-contained `<canvas>` pipeline, independent of
the app's PDF/JPEG route:

```
exportPixelArtPng(pixelArt, { scale, transparentBg, includeGrid }):
  native = renderPixelGridToCanvas(pixelArt, frame)      // width × height
  out    = canvas(width*scale, height*scale)
  ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false
  ctx.drawImage(native, 0, 0, out.width, out.height)
  return out.toBlob('image/png')
```

- **Scale:** 1× / 2× / 4× / 8× (nearest-neighbour always).
- **Transparent background** on/off; **include grid lines** on/off.
- `image/png` is the one format `toBlob()` is guaranteed to support;
  WebP is an easy later add.

Animation export (Phase C): **GIF** — Canvas can't `toBlob('image/gif')`,
so this needs a vendored JS/WASM encoder (e.g. `gif.js`), fed each
frame's rendered `ImageData` + `durationMs`. Also **sprite-sheet PNG**
(all frames tiled) + a `metadata.json`, which needs no new dependency.

---

## Phased delivery

### Phase A — Pixel layer, editor core, Nostr
- The `pixelart` layer type + `pixelArt` data model (RLE, frames-of-one).
- `renderPixelGridToCanvas` + crisp layer rendering everywhere
  (editor artboard, preview-DOM renderer, feed cards).
- The `#pixelEditorView` with the core tools (pencil / eraser / fill /
  eyedropper), palette panel, grid toggle, mirror, editor zoom.
- "Add Layer → Pixel Art"; the per-layer "Edit pixels" round-trip.
- The standalone "Pixel Art" Designer-tab layout (`templateMode:
  'pixelart'`).
- Save / load / publish / fork as `casewrap-pixelart`; feed card;
  `pixel-art` category; `pixelart` in `MODE_LABELS` / mode filters.

**Ship gate:** paint a 32×32 sprite, see it render crisp as a layer in a
Custom Art design and as a standalone design; save, reload, publish — it
round-trips and shows in the feed.

### Phase B — Raster export + editor extras
- PNG export at 1×/2×/4×/8×, transparency + optional grid.
- Line / rectangle / ellipse tools; flip H/V; rotate 90°; grid resize.
- Import a published `casewrap-pixelart` design as a layer (the
  disc-design-style remix flow).

**Ship gate:** export a sprite as a transparent 8× PNG; import a
published pixel design into another design as a layer.

### Phase C — Animation
- `frames[]` timeline UI: add / duplicate / delete / reorder frames,
  per-frame duration, loop/fps; onion-skin; playback preview.
- GIF export (vendored encoder); sprite-sheet PNG + metadata export.

**Ship gate:** build a 4-frame loop, preview it, export a working GIF and
a sprite sheet.

### Phase D — Conversion & advanced tools
- Image import → nearest-neighbour downscale / palette quantization →
  editable grid.
- Selection + move; dither brush; symmetry mode; tile preview.

### Later / backlog
- WebP / APNG / animated-WebP export.
- Blossom offload + an external `manifest` form for very large art.
- Animated pixel layers driving Stack actions (a sprite that plays on
  `onClick`).

## Risks & tradeoffs

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| First real raster/`<canvas>` layer in a DOM-vector app | One shared `renderPixelGridToCanvas`; `image-rendering: pixelated`; the layer is still a normal DOM node hosting a `<canvas>`. |
| No direct canvas raster export exists today | PNG export of *pixel content* is self-contained (`toBlob`), independent of the PDF/JPEG route; whole-design PNG is explicitly out of scope. |
| GIF needs a new vendored dependency | Deferred to Phase C; isolated to export; sprite-sheet export (no dependency) ships alongside as the lighter option. |
| Per-pixel undo would swamp the 50-deep history | A whole drag-stroke / fill / transform is one `pushHistory` entry, taken at gesture start. |
| Large grids / many frames inflate the event → silent relay drops | Encoded size is gated against a NIP-11-derived budget (min `max_event_size` across the user's relays, 64 KB fallback): soft warning ~50%, hard block ~90%; the encoder stores the smaller of RLE / base64; oversized animations offload via Blossom (Phase C). See **Size limits**. |
| Pixels stretched / blurred by a non-matching layer box | Layer box defaults to the grid aspect; W/H aspect-lock defaults on; `image-rendering: pixelated` everywhere including print. |
| A pixel layer inside a host's PDF/print export | Verify the print path rasterises the `<canvas>` crisply; fall back to a high-scale PNG draw if needed. |
| Palette index overflow | Palette capped at 256 entries (one byte per index). |

## Open questions

1. **`templateMode: 'pixelart'`** on the Designer tab — confirmed?
2. **v1 core tool set** — pencil / eraser / fill / eyedropper + palette /
   grid / mirror / zoom — right cut?
3. **New-grid size options** — 32×32 default is set; which other presets
   to offer (16 / 32 / 64 / 128 / custom)?
4. **Editor zoom** — reuse the bottom `#canvasToolbar` slot, or a
   dedicated pixel-editor zoom control?
5. **GIF encoder** — OK to vendor one (`gif.js` or similar) in Phase C?
6. **Budget thresholds** — soft 50% / hard 90% — the right percentages,
   and is 64 KB the right NIP-11 fallback?

## Acceptance summary

### Phase A
- [ ] A `pixelart` layer renders crisp (nearest-neighbour) at any scale,
      in the editor, previews, and feed cards.
- [ ] The Pixel Editor view paints with pencil / eraser / fill /
      eyedropper; palette add/edit/remove; grid + mirror; editor zoom.
- [ ] "Add Layer → Pixel Art" works in any design; "Edit pixels" enters
      the editor and "Done" writes back.
- [ ] A standalone Pixel Art design saves / loads / publishes / forks as
      `casewrap-pixelart` and shows in the feed under `pixel-art`.
- [ ] A drag-stroke is a single undo step.
- [ ] Publishing is gated on the event-size budget — a live size readout
      in the editor, a soft warning, then a hard block — so a pixel
      design can never be silently dropped by relays.

### Phase B
- [ ] PNG export at 1×/2×/4×/8× with transparency and optional grid.
- [ ] Line / rect / ellipse, flip, rotate, grid resize.
- [ ] A published pixel design imports into any design as a layer.

### Phase C
- [ ] A multi-frame sprite plays back; onion-skin works.
- [ ] GIF export and sprite-sheet export both produce correct files.

### Phase D
- [x] An imported PNG/JPEG converts to an editable pixel grid.
- [x] An animated GIF imports as one editor frame per GIF frame,
      sharing one palette, at the source's own playback rate.
- [ ] Selection/move and the advanced brushes work.
